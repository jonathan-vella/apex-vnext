# APEX Azure Compliance Assessment

Use this skill for an active APEX task that evaluates accepted posture evidence.
It does not certify compliance, perform a scan, disclose sensitive material, or
authorize remediation.

## Prerequisites

- `apex/taskContext` identifies the target scope, applicable control source,
  assessment question, sensitivity boundary, and freshness policy.
- Capability-produced evidence includes its producer, evidence hash, target
  scope, observation time, completeness, redactions, and control mapping.
- A finding is traceable to an observed configuration or item metadata. A
  recommendation without mapped evidence remains an observation.

## Workflow

1. Confirm that evidence scope matches the intended subscription, resource
   group, resource, or vault boundary and identify omitted targets explicitly.
2. Separate control status, security posture signal, reliability signal, and
   cost observation. Do not turn one category into another.
3. Correlate findings by control, affected target, severity rationale, and
   evidence hash. Avoid counting duplicate signals as separate exposure.
4. For expiration evidence, apply the interpretation rules in
   [compliance finding criteria](references/compliance-finding-criteria.md).
5. Return a triaged, redacted finding set and route remediation decisions to
   the kernel-authorized owner. Escalate potential active exposure or outage
   indicators without asserting exploitation or incident cause.

## Boundaries

- Do not run external assessments, enumerate resources, inspect vault content,
  or request secret values. All observations are scoped capability-produced
  evidence and must remain redacted to the task's approved boundary.
- Do not represent a partial assessment as compliant, noncompliant, or secure.
- Do not prescribe, apply, or validate remediation. This skill identifies the
  evidence-backed need and escalation boundary only.
- Route spend questions to cost assessment, live service symptoms to diagnostic
  assessment, and policy-scope interpretation to the applicable governance task.

## Output

Return target scope, control basis, evidence hashes, freshness, redaction and
coverage limits, findings, severity rationale, uncertainty, escalation need,
and kernel-provided next action.
