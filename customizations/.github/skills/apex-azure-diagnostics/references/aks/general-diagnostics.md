# General AKS Investigation & Diagnostics

## "What happened in my cluster?"

When a user asks a broad question like "what happened in my AKS cluster?" or "check my AKS status", follow this
systematic flow:

1. Cluster health
2. Recent events
3. Node status
4. Unhealthy pods
5. All pods overview
6. System pods health
7. Activity log

Run the **[`aks-baseline`](../script-examples/aks-baseline.sh.md)** script instead of issuing these commands one by one.
It performs the entire read-only sweep above and prints a single labeled digest (provisioning state, node pool summary,
recent activity log, node readiness, unhealthy pods, kube-system health, and recent warning events), so you get one
summarized result instead of seven raw dumps.

```bash
# bash
./scripts/aks-baseline.sh -g <rg> -n <cluster> [--namespace <ns>]
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
.\scripts\aks-baseline.ps1 -ResourceGroup <rg> -Cluster <cluster> [-Namespace <ns>]
```

After reviewing the digest, deep-dive into a specific pod with `kubectl describe` / `kubectl logs`.

## AKS CLI Tools

```bash
# Get cluster credentials (required before kubectl commands)
az aks get-credentials -g <rg> -n <cluster>

# View node pools
az aks nodepool list -g <rg> --cluster-name <cluster> -o table
```

### AppLens (MCP) for AKS

For AI-powered diagnostics:

```text
mcp_azure-mcp_applens
  intent: "diagnose AKS cluster issues"
  command: "diagnose"
  parameters:
    resourceId: "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<cluster>"
```

> 💡 **Tip:** AppLens automatically detects common issues and provides remediation recommendations using the cluster
> resource ID.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with kubectl get/describe** - Always check basic status first
2. **Check events** - `kubectl get events -A` reveals recent issues
3. **Use systematic isolation** - Pod -> Node -> Cluster -> Network
4. **Document changes** - Note what you tried and what worked
5. **Escalate when needed** - For control plane issues, contact Azure support
