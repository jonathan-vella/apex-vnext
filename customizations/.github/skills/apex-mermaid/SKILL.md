# APEX Inline Mermaid

The current APEX document registry declares no Mermaid-capable slots. Do not request or emit an inline Mermaid fence
until a renderer registers a typed source, a supported slot, syntax validation, and a returned document receipt.

## Prerequisites

- The target template exposes a Mermaid-capable inline slot.
- Accepted artifact data contains every node, relationship, label, and time value to be shown.
- The renderer declares supported Mermaid syntax and validation behavior.

## Future Renderer Contract

When a renderer-supported slot exists, select the simplest diagram type that preserves accepted relationships. Apply
[syntax guidance](references/syntax.md) and [styling guidance](references/styling.md), then submit only the bounded
fence to that renderer. The renderer, rather than this skill, must validate syntax and return the document receipt.

## Boundaries

- Do not create standalone architecture, network, runtime, as-built, WAF, cost, or compliance diagrams.
- Do not write or edit files, invoke deployment, or mutate source-of-truth artifacts, templates, schemas, or state.
- Do not use unaccepted inputs, infer missing values, or treat rendered Markdown as gate evidence.
- Do not embed Azure service icons, custom SVG, secrets, physical principal IDs, unsafe links, or Mermaid click actions.
- Do not claim syntax or visual validation from model inspection; only the renderer receipt supplies that evidence.

## Blockers

When the requested document slot is unsupported, absent, or cannot be filled from accepted data, return a blocker that
names the slot, diagram type, and missing renderer support or artifact data. Also block when renderer-version syntax,
escaping, or accessibility cannot be validated. Do not emit a substitute diagram or alter any source.

## Output

Return only the renderer request or its rendered inline document result and receipt. Preserve any projected artifact and
template hashes, validation status, and unresolved blockers.
