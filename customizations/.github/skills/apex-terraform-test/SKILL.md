# APEX Terraform Test Design

Use this skill for an active Terraform test-design or validation task. It specifies coverage and assertion intent;
authorized capabilities own test materialization, execution, environment access, and evidence production.

## Prerequisites

- `apex/taskContext` identifies the accepted Terraform binding, scoped target, test objective, and acceptance criteria.
- The exact provider and module locks are accepted for the binding under test.
- Required test or validation capability receipts are accepted and current for the same target.

## Workflow

1. Classify the requirement with [Test design](references/test-design.md): deterministic unit, negative validation,
   mock-backed behavior, or integration behavior.
2. Define observable assertions, expected failures, test inputs, and isolation boundaries without assuming unobserved
   provider behavior.
3. Apply [Evidence acceptance](references/evidence-acceptance.md) to distinguish test-design intent from accepted
   execution evidence.
4. Submit the test specification through an authorized capability. Return unavailable capabilities, absent environment
   authorization, stale locks, or incomplete evidence as blockers.
5. Apply [Plan-mode test design](references/plan-mode-test-design.md) for deterministic coverage. Apply-mode and
   real-provider work remain blocked until separately authorized.

## Boundaries

- Do not write or run test files, configure providers, access environments, or mutate files.
- Do not invoke Terraform, inspect provider registries, query cloud state, or create infrastructure.
- A mock-backed result does not establish live-service behavior; an integration result does not authorize deployment.
