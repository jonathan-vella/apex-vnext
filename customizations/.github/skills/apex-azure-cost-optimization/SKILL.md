# APEX Azure Cost Optimization

Use this skill for an active APEX assessment that evaluates spending and utilization evidence. It is advisory only:
evidence informs findings, and the kernel decides whether a later task may authorize a change.

## Prerequisites

- `apex/taskContext` identifies the target subscriptions, resource boundary, assessment period, currency, and the cost
  question to answer.
- Each evidence record identifies its source, observation time, freshness, target scope, completeness, and redactions.
- Cost, utilization, inventory, and pricing evidence use compatible scopes and periods. Missing, stale, partial, or
  scope-mismatched evidence is a blocker.

## Routing

| Question | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| What did we spend, and on what? | `apex-azure-pricing/query_costs`; `query_aks_costs` for AKS cluster or namespace breakdowns |
| What will we spend? | `apex-azure-pricing/forecast_costs` |
| What would a different SKU or tier cost? | `apex-azure-pricing/get_retail_prices` |
| Are commitments used well? | `list_benefit_utilization`, `get_benefit_recommendations`, `list_reservation_transactions` |
| Where can we save? | The assessment workflow below |

Use the read-only `apex-azure-pricing` tools the active agent declares first, within the limits in
[cost tool guardrails](references/cost-tool-guardrails.md). Never call `create_budget` or price-sheet download tools.
Resource inventory, utilization metrics, Redis listings and advisor recommendations come from the read-only Azure CLI
commands in [cost CLI workflow](references/cost-cli-workflow.md) and
[Azure Resource Graph cost queries](references/azure-resource-graph.md). When neither source is available, the gap is a
blocker for findings that need it, never permission to estimate from memory.

## Rules

- **Read-only.** Never delete, resize, stop, purchase, or retier anything during an assessment.
- **Real data.** Ground every finding in returned cost, metric, or price evidence and label it with its evidence class.
- **Whole bill.** Present savings next to the scope's total actual cost for the same period.
- **Redis scope.** Use the Redis-specific signals only for an explicitly Redis-only request; a mixed request keeps the
  whole scope and adds Redis signals for those resources.
- **Safe classification.** Classify every candidate and never present a candidate as an approved action.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the target scope and whether the request is portfolio-wide, resource-specific, or Redis-specific. Do not
   expand the boundary from names, tags, or model memory.
2. Query actual cost for the scope and period first, then forecasts or prices only as the question requires.
3. Separate observed cost from observed utilization, validated price context, and calculated savings. A calculated
   estimate is not an invoice prediction.
4. Evaluate only evidence-backed candidates using [cost assessment criteria](references/cost-assessment-criteria.md).
5. Classify each candidate as `safe to investigate`, `review required`, or `high risk`. State dependencies, uncertainty,
   evidence source, and freshness.
6. Return ranked opportunities, non-actionable observations, and blockers. Send any proposed configuration, purchase,
   scaling, or deletion decision to the kernel-authorized owning workflow.

## Azure CLI and azd

- **Read and diagnostic** commands (`az account show|list`, `az resource list`, `az graph query`,
  `az monitor metrics list`, `az redis list|show`, azqr scans, and the Cost Management Query API through
  `az rest --method post` as a fallback) may run directly against the approved scope. Their output is an observation;
  a finding still carries a labeled evidence class.
- **Commands that change Azure** (deletes, resizes, stops, tier or SKU changes, purchases, budgets) are never run by
  the agent. They reach Azure only through `apex preview`, a Gate 4 decision and `apex deploy` (Bicep, Terraform, or
  `azd provision` and `azd deploy` for labs), or through the approved GitHub Actions workflow, which runs only the
  preview that local Gate 4 bound to its CI recipient. Production CI apply stays blocked until recipient-bound
  transport is qualified.

Prerequisites for the CLI path: `az login` for the intended tenant, the `costmanagement` and `resource-graph`
extensions, azqr for orphan discovery, and Cost Management Reader, Monitoring Reader and Reader on the scope.

## Boundaries

- Do not treat an orphan candidate, an unused-looking resource, or a missing tag as proof that removal or downsizing is
  safe.
- Do not promise savings where pricing evidence is absent, free allowances may apply, shared allocation is uncertain,
  or the calculation cannot be traced.
- Escalate evidence that indicates an availability, security, compliance, or active incident concern to the
  kernel-selected owning assessment.

## Output

Return the target scope, assessment period, total actual cost, evidence sources and freshness, findings, estimated
savings with method, uncertainty, classification, and kernel-provided next action. Use `indeterminate` when evidence
cannot support the conclusion.
