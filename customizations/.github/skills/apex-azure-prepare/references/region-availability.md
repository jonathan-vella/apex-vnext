## How to Use

1. Check if your architecture includes any **limited availability** services below
2. If yes → consult the service-specific file or use the MCP tool to list supported regions with sufficient quota for
   that service, and only offer regions that support ALL services
3. If all services are "available everywhere" → offer common regions

## MCP Tools Used

| Tool                  | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mcp_azure-mcp_quota` | Check Azure region availability and quota by setting `command` to `quota_usage_check` or `quota_region_availability_list` |
