# APEX Entra App Registration Guidance

Use this skill only for an active architecture, planning, or approved implementation-binding task. The kernel owns
task state, evidence freshness, authorization, artifact acceptance, and all state-changing work.

## Prerequisites

- `apex/taskContext` identifies the active task, allowed outputs, applicable requirements, and evidence references.
- The workload purpose, client type, tenant boundary, target APIs, and user-interaction model are known; otherwise
  return `needs_input`.
- An identity operation is available only through a kernel-authorized capability. A request alone is not authority to
  create or alter an application registration.

## Workflow

1. Model the application type, audience, tenant model, redirect-URI class, and OAuth interaction.
   Record the selected flow and rationale without protocol requests or application configuration.
2. Map each business operation to the minimum delegated or application permission requirement.
   Record consent ownership, scope, and unresolved permission evidence; do not infer or approve consent.
3. Select a credential posture: public clients hold no credential; Azure-hosted workloads prefer managed identity.
   Confidential workloads prefer federation or certificates over secrets; record lifecycle ownership, never a value.
4. Submit typed identity intent only through the kernel-authorized capability named in the task envelope.
   Preserve its receipt or blocker in the architecture, plan, or binding artifact.
5. Handoff approved identity intent to the authorized implementation, validation, or operations capability.
   Do not claim that registration, permissions, credentials, or consent exist without an accepted receipt.

## Boundaries

Do not use portal, CLI, Microsoft Graph, SDK, HTTP, IaC, repository, source-scanning, or file-mutation actions. Do
not create registrations, configure redirect URIs, grant consent, assign permissions, create or handle credentials,
expose identifiers or secret material, test authentication, or deploy. Direct operational requests must be converted
into bounded intent and an authorized capability handoff.

## References

- [OAuth and registration model](references/oauth-registration-model.md) - client, audience, flow, and redirect-URI decisions.
- [Permissions and credential posture](references/permissions-and-credentials.md) - least privilege and credential trade-offs.
- [Capability receipt and handoff](references/capability-receipts.md) - required evidence, blockers, and next-task rules.

## Output

Return typed identity design intent, requirement traces, authorized capability receipt references, explicit blockers,
and the next kernel-controlled task.
