# APEX Entra App Registration Guidance

Use this skill only for an active architecture, planning, or approved implementation-binding task. The kernel owns
task state, evidence freshness, authorization, artifact acceptance, and all state-changing work.

## Prerequisites

- `apex/taskContext` identifies the active task, allowed outputs, applicable requirements, and evidence references.
- The workload purpose, client type, tenant boundary, target APIs, and user-interaction model are known; otherwise
  return `needs_input`.
- An identity operation is available only through a kernel-authorized capability. A request alone is not authority to
  create or alter an application registration.

## Rules

- **Least-privilege permissions.** Request only the scopes or application permissions the workload uses.
- **Credentials by environment.** Public clients hold none; Azure-hosted workloads use managed identity; other
  confidential workloads prefer federation or certificates over secrets.
- **Consent is a decision.** Application permissions and privileged delegated permissions need admin consent from an
  authorized owner; never infer or approve it.
- **Additive rotation.** A new credential coexists with the old one until consumers validate it; retiring the old one
  is a separate approved step.
- **Exact HTTPS redirects.** Redirect URIs are exact matches on the correct platform and use HTTPS outside local
  development.
- **Validate tokens.** Resource APIs validate issuer, audience, and expiry.
- **Graph consent is not Azure RBAC.** Access to Azure resources is designed with `apex-azure-rbac`.

## Workflow

1. Model the application type, audience, tenant model, redirect-URI class, and OAuth interaction.
   Record the selected flow and rationale without protocol requests or application configuration.
2. Map each business operation to the minimum delegated or application permission requirement.
   Record consent ownership, scope, and unresolved permission evidence; do not infer or approve consent.
3. Select a credential posture and record lifecycle ownership and rotation, never a value.
4. Submit typed identity intent only through the kernel-authorized capability named in the task envelope.
   Preserve its receipt or blocker in the architecture, plan, or binding artifact.
5. Hand off approved identity intent to the authorized implementation, validation, or operations capability.
   Do not claim that registration, permissions, credentials, or consent exist without an accepted receipt.
6. Classify observed identity failures with [identity design and diagnostic rules](references/design-and-diagnostics.md).
   Return the responsible owner and evidence gap without attempting remediation.

## Azure CLI and azd

[CLI commands](references/cli-commands.md) keeps the upstream `az ad` commands, scripts and troubleshooting checks, and
[Graph Bicep example](references/graph-bicep-example.md) keeps the Microsoft Graph Bicep registration.

- **Read and diagnostic** commands (`az ad app list|show`, `az ad app credential list`, `az ad app permission list`,
  `az ad sp list|show`, `az ad signed-in-user show`, `az account show`) may run directly for the intended tenant. Their
  output is an observation; identity design still cites accepted capability receipts. Never print credential values or
  tokens.
- **Commands that change Entra ID** (creating, updating or deleting registrations and service principals, credentials,
  permissions, admin consent, owners) are never run by the agent. The registration ships as Microsoft Graph Bicep and
  reaches Entra ID only through `apex preview`, a Gate 4 decision and `apex deploy` (Bicep, Terraform, or `azd
  provision` and `azd deploy` for labs), or through the approved GitHub Actions workflow, which runs only the preview
  that local Gate 4 bound to its CI recipient. Production CI apply stays blocked until recipient-bound transport is
  qualified. Admin consent stays an authorized owner's decision. References mark these commands with `# Changes
  Azure`.

## Boundaries

Do not use portal, Microsoft Graph, SDK, HTTP, repository, source-scanning, or file-mutation actions, or any command
that changes Entra ID. Do not create registrations, configure redirect URIs, grant consent, assign permissions, create
or handle credentials, expose identifiers beyond the task boundary, tokens, or secret material, test authentication,
or deploy. Direct operational requests must be converted into bounded intent and an authorized capability handoff.

  redirect-URI decisions.
- [Permissions and credential posture](references/permissions-and-credentials.md) - access models, consent, and
  credential trade-offs.
- [Capability receipt and handoff](references/capability-receipts.md) - required evidence, blockers, and next-task rules.
- [Identity design and diagnostic rules](references/design-and-diagnostics.md) - flow, permission, and sign-in error
  classification without configuration or protocol operations.

  commands, scripts, and troubleshooting checks.

  principal.

## Output

Return typed identity design intent, requirement traces, authorized capability receipt references, explicit blockers,
and the next kernel-controlled task.
