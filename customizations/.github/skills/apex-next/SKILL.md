description: "Routes the next APEX kernel step inside the same APEX agent by mapping owner roles to stage skills or hidden workers."
---

When calling any `apex/*` MCP tool, include the current session checkout or worktree as the required absolute
`workspace` path.

## APEX Next

Route the next APEX step from kernel state. The kernel selects the owner role; the foreground `APEX` agent remains
active and loads the mapped skill, or delegates one hidden worker.

## Prerequisites

- The workspace has the APEX CLI and MCP server configured.
- A project is selected unless the current operation is project listing, creation, selection, replacement or deletion.

## Workflow

1. Call `apex/status` first. For a status-only request, no selected project, a pending gate, a blocker, or a terminal
   run, report the kernel state and stop.
2. Call `apex/nextTask` only after status leaves runnable work for the selected project. Do not call it again for the
   same unanswered input request or unresolved review, and do not poll.
3. Map the kernel result to a same-agent skill or hidden worker. Do not ask the user to choose a role and do not search
   session history.

   | `request.intake`                     | `apex-requirements`              |
   | `request.decision`                   | `apex-architecture`              |

   | `needs_review` for Gate 2            | `apex-architecture`              |
   | `needs_review` for Gate 3            | `apex-planning`                  |

   Treat `status=needs_input`, `status=needs_review`, `status=task` and the exact `task.taskId` as authoritative
   result shapes; never coerce one shape into another.
   If a role or result is not mapped, report the unmapped role and stop; do not invent an owner.
4. Continue in the same foreground `APEX` agent for every same-agent skill. Load the mapped skill and carry the user's
   requested outcome, exact stop point and prohibited operations verbatim. Continue only until that requested outcome
   reaches its next stop point.
5. For a worker task, delegate through `task` with the exact `task.taskId`. Tell the worker to call
   `apex/taskContext` with that task ID for complete inputs, acceptance criteria and output paths. Include the user's
   requested outcome and stop boundary. Do not provide model, model-policy or reasoning-effort.
6. After worker completion or same-agent stage completion, call `apex/status`. If a gate is pending, report it and stop.
   Never call `apex/nextTask` after `apex/reviewDecide` or `apex/reviewComplete` while a gate is pending.

## Boundaries

- No `/agent` switching, Agent picker directions, copyable specialist prompts or interactive specialist handoffs.
- Delegate only `APEX CodeGen`, `APEX Reviewer` and `APEX Validator`.
- Never delegate intake, user questions, gate decisions, governance selection, or any other interactive work.
- Never collect, answer, summarize or record a question unless the kernel returned it to the active `APEX` agent.
- Never replace invalid choices with defaults or recommendations.
- Never use `session_store_sql`, SQL, session-history searches or tool discovery to route work.

## Output

Report the mapped skill or worker, the kernel task/request/review identifier, the carried stop point, and the next
action. If the requested outcome is complete, summarize and stop.
