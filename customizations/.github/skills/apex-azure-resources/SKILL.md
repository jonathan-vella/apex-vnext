# APEX Azure Resource Inventory Guidance

Use this skill for an active APEX task that needs a bounded view of existing Azure resources. Only capability-produced,
accepted inventory evidence in `apex/taskContext`, or the recorded inventory that `apex/inventory` returns for the
selected run, is authoritative.

## Prerequisites

- The task identifies the inventory question, target subscription set, resource-group boundary when applicable, and
  result limit.
- Accepted evidence records the scope, query intent or pattern, observation time, result completeness, and redactions
  or truncation.

Return a blocker when inventory evidence is missing, stale, incomplete, or outside the requested scope. Do not present a
partial page as a complete inventory, and do not infer resource state from names or model memory.

## Rules

- **Read-only.** Inventory never changes resources; remediation belongs to its authorized capability.
- **Scoped.** An inventory answer applies only to its recorded subscriptions, resource groups, types, and observation
  time. A row limit is not an authorization or completeness boundary.
- **Indexed, not live.** Resource Graph style inventories lag behind changes; they are not real-time monitoring.
- **Candidates, not verdicts.** An orphan or untagged result is a candidate until dependency and owner evidence confirm
  it.
- **No secrets.** Represent keys, connection strings, and secret references by name only in any summary or diagram.

## Workflow

1. Match the evidence scope to the task's subscriptions, resource groups, resource types, and observation time.
2. Confirm the inventory pattern answers the stated question, such as type inventory, location inventory, orphan
   candidate, tag coverage, or configuration posture.
3. Treat pagination, result limits, redactions, and indexing delay as explicit inventory boundaries.
4. Report only observed resource facts and label orphan candidates as candidates until accepted dependency evidence
   confirms them.
5. Carry the evidence identifier, scope, pattern, observation time, and completeness status into the typed analysis or
   planning artifact.
6. Route a missing or inadequate inventory to the resource-inventory capability with a narrower or corrected query
   intent.
7. When the user asks for a diagram of accepted inventory, use `apex-mermaid`; never diagram unrecorded resources.

## Azure CLI and azd

[Azure Resource Graph queries](references/azure-resource-graph.md) keeps the upstream `az graph query` commands, lookup
workflow and KQL patterns for inventory, orphan candidates, tags, health and services.

- **Read and diagnostic** commands (`az graph query`, `az resource list`, service `list` and `show` commands) may run
  directly against the approved subscriptions. Their output is an observation; the typed inventory decision still cites
  accepted evidence from `apex/taskContext` or `apex/inventory`.
- **Commands that change Azure** (create, update, delete, tag, move) are never run by the agent. Remediation reaches
  Azure only through `apex preview`, a Gate 4 decision and `apex deploy` (Bicep, Terraform, or `azd provision` and
  `azd deploy` for labs), or through the approved GitHub Actions workflow, which runs only the preview that local Gate
  4 bound to its CI recipient. Production CI apply stays blocked until recipient-bound transport is qualified.

## Boundaries

- This skill does not create files or modify resources. A direct Resource Graph read is an observation, not accepted
  inventory evidence.
- Inventory evidence is not real-time monitoring, compliance certification, cost analysis, or deployment authorization.
- Remediation and resource changes require their authorized capability and gate; this skill may only describe the
  evidence-backed need.
