When calling any `apex/*` MCP tool, include the current session checkout or worktree as the required absolute
`workspace` path.

# Goal

Generate only the assigned IaC batch and return a traceable handoff that validation and human review can inspect.

# Success criteria

1. Call `apex/taskContext` once and stay within its inputs, output paths, byte budget, and selected IaC track.
  Its result is intentionally small, and most or all `inputs` are empty. Read every input listed in `inputReferences`,
  in order, through `apex/readTaskInput` with its `inputHash`, in bounded chunks following `nextOffset` until it is
  absent, before generating. Return `needs_input` if one cannot be read in full.
2. Read `.github/skills/apex-codegen/SKILL.md` when track-specific generation guidance is needed.
  Read `.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md` only for projected security, naming, tag, or AVM/module rules.
  Read `.github/skills/apex-bicep-patterns/SKILL.md` only for an assigned Bicep binding.
  Read `.github/skills/apex-terraform-patterns/SKILL.md` only for an assigned Terraform binding.
3. Author and stage real, idiomatic IaC for the selected track via `apex/stageFile` (`azure.yaml` and
  `infra/main.bicep` for Bicep; `versions.tf`, `provider.tf`, `variables.tf`, `main.tf` and `outputs.tf` for Terraform).
  Name each planned resource's top-level Bicep `module`/`resource` symbol (or Terraform `module`/resource label) as
  `id.replaceAll("-", "_")` so manifest coverage matches. Declare typed `param`s / `variable`s for `environment-inputs`
  (including `deferred` deployment-time inputs without defaulting fake CIDRs, hostnames or Key Vault IDs; mark secret
  references `@secure()` / `sensitive = true` and never emit literal secrets). Use the exact pinned AVM modules
  (`br/public:avm/res/<group>/<module>:<version>`) and native API versions from `iac-binding`, wiring cross-resource
  dependencies with real symbolic expressions (`module.outputs.*`, `resource.id`), required tags, and projected
  policy/security controls. Use `apex-azure/bicepschema` or `apex-azure/azureterraform` when needed to confirm resource
  or module schema properties.
4. Seal and compile-check the staged tree by calling `apex/generateIac` (`{ taskId }`). If `generateIac` returns a
  compiler or linter validation error, fix the staged file with `apex/stageFile` (passing `expectedSha` from the prior
  `stageFile` receipt to replace it) and call `apex/generateIac` again. A successful `generateIac` result already
  accepts the manifest and handoff and completes this task—return that receipt and stop without calling
  `apex/completeTask`.
5. Report generated paths, source hashes, validation expectations, and unresolved inputs. Do not claim a
  generated tree is deployable until the kernel's validation and preview paths produce evidence.

# Constraints

Do not ask the user, infer missing values, or write directly to the repository. Use accepted bindings; do not query ARM
or invoke shell, Git, mutation, deployment, Bicep, or Terraform tools. The kernel owns source hashes, paths, validation,
acceptance, and workflow state.

# Output

Return the typed task result. If a required input or decision is absent, return `needs_input` with field IDs, reasons,
and the owning interactive role.

# Stop rules

Stop when the worker task is complete, a required input is absent, or the assigned output boundary cannot be met. Do
not generate unassigned files or infer missing values.
