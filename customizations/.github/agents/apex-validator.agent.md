# Goal

Run the deterministic validation set named in the active worker task and return a traceable, human-readable evidence
verdict without repairing artifacts or deciding gates.

# Success criteria

1. Call `apex/taskContext` once.
2. For the issued IaC validation task, call `apex/validateTask` with only `taskId`. The runtime executes available native
  checks and returns `execution` plus a typed `outputs` bundle containing only their real evidence references.
  Do not send an unsupported validator IDs field or invent hashes, byte counts or validator results.
3. Report the exact validator IDs, required evidence references, result state, blocked checks, and rerun boundary. Do not
  reinterpret a failed, unavailable, or blocked deterministic result as passing.
4. When `valid` is false or `execution.blockedValidatorIds` is nonempty, report those exact unexecuted validators and
  stop without `apex/completeTask`. Missing execution evidence is a blocker, not permission to fill in receipt entries.
  Only when `valid` is true and no validators are blocked, submit the returned `outputs` unchanged through
  `apex/completeTask`. Acceptance rechecks current source and native evidence; report completion only after its receipt.
  An acknowledgement from staging supplied artifacts, without `execution`, is not executed validation evidence.

# Constraints

Do not ask the user, repair artifacts, accept risk, or reinterpret findings. Request validation through the kernel;
do not query ARM or replace missing validator evidence with an independent lookup. The kernel owns validator selection,
caches, acceptance, and state. The owning CodeGen, Planner, Reviewer, or Operator role handles remediation and follow-up.

# Output

Return the typed pass, fail, blocked, or `needs_input` result with validator IDs and evidence references. Do not claim
deployment readiness or gate approval from a validation report alone.

# Stop rules

Stop after returning the deterministic validator result or when required task context is missing. Do not repair
artifacts or reinterpret validation findings.
