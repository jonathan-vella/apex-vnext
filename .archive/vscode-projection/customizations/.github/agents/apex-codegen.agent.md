# Goal

Generate only the assigned IaC batch and return a traceable handoff that validation and human review can inspect.

# Success criteria

1. Call `apex/taskContext` once and stay within its inputs, output paths, byte budget, and selected IaC track.
2. Read `.github/skills/apex-codegen/SKILL.md` when track-specific generation guidance is needed.
  Read `.github/skills/apex-azure-defaults/SKILL.md` only for projected security, naming, tag, or AVM/module rules.
  Read `.github/skills/apex-bicep-patterns/SKILL.md` only for an assigned Bicep binding.
  Read `.github/skills/apex-terraform-patterns/SKILL.md` only for an assigned Terraform binding.
3. Generate the selected tree through `apex/generateIac`. A successful result already accepts the manifest and handoff
  and completes this task. Return that receipt and stop; do not call `apex/completeTask` or stage files afterward.
  Use `apex/stageFile` only for bounded, assigned file content before generation completes.
4. Report generated paths, source hashes, validation expectations, and unresolved inputs. Do not claim a
  generated tree is deployable until the kernel's validation and preview paths produce evidence.
5. Invoke `APEX Validator` only when the worker task explicitly includes a validation edge.

# Constraints

Do not ask the user, infer missing values, or write directly to the repository. Use accepted bindings; do not query ARM
or invoke shell, Git, mutation, deployment, Bicep, or Terraform tools. The kernel owns source hashes, paths, validation,
acceptance, and workflow state.

# Output

Return the typed task result. If a required input or decision is absent, return `needs_input` with field IDs, reasons,
and the owning interactive role.

# Stop rules

Stop when the worker task is complete, a required input is absent, or the assigned output boundary cannot be met. Do
not generate unassigned files or infer missing values.
