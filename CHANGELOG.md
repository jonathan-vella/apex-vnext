# Changelog

All notable changes to **APEX vNext** are documented in this file.

Release history is available through the repository's **Releases** tab. The
current repository version is recorded in [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] — Unreleased

This release line was extracted from the qualified vNext integration head in
the original APEX repository. See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) for provenance.

### Added (APEX vNext Phase 0A baseline)

- feat(vnext): added durable project controls, structured work-item and regression intake, and an offline validator for
  requirement references, local links, issue-form fields, and frozen Phase 0A evidence.
- docs(vnext): added approved v1 baseline decisions, candidate transcripts and manifest, the
  preserve/change/retire compatibility matrix, deterministic golden scenarios,
  the known-defects ledger, and the v1 maintenance policy. The baseline tag
  remains blocked pending a clean-commit evidence rerun.
- feat(scripts): added `validate:v1-compatibility-matrix`, which compares the
  Phase 0A matrix with live agent definitions, schemas, workflow nodes, MCP
  servers, and `apex-recall` commands.
- fix(scripts): bound Azure Pricing MCP tests to the component virtual
  environment, installed its development extras, declared the root Python test
  runner, and installed the independently locked documentation-site toolchain
  during devcontainer setup. CI now creates the same component environment and
  selects each matrix image in the job's ephemeral canonical devcontainer config,
  preserving local-feature resolution within the required workspace trust boundary.
  The v1 compatibility validator now invokes the repository-owned `apex-recall`
  module instead of requiring a globally installed console script.
- docs(vnext): narrowed the first-release Copilot client scope to VS Code and
  deferred GitHub Copilot CLI support.
- docs(vnext): revised the rewrite plan around workspace-native customizations,
  direct interactive handoffs, model-tier-safe subagents, a durable walking
  skeleton, contract waves, an early dual-track proof, lazy capability packs,
  cached validation, inherited promotion gates, bounded evidence, writer
  transfer, and secure Terraform CI plan transport.
- feat(vnext): implemented the TypeScript contracts, kernel, authorized
  capabilities, deterministic renderers, CLI/MCP control plane, testkit,
  managed VS Code customizations, runtime configuration, native IaC generation
  and provider adapters, capability-pack management, schema export, validation,
  reproducible package/SBOM/provenance tooling, deterministic qualification,
  CI lanes, and versioned preview documentation. Live VS Code agent behavior,
  Azure deployment-stack behavior, production Terraform CI plan transport, and
  final release scorecard evidence remain explicit pre-cutover gates.
- feat(vnext): added a strict live-qualification evidence contract and deterministic
  `live:vnext` template, validation, and rendering commands that bind manual VS Code,
  GitHub, and Azure results to exact candidate and evidence hashes without executing
  approvals or cloud operations.
- feat(vnext): added a generic authenticated AES-256-GCM envelope and deterministic repository-state transfer commands
  with a selected-run allowlist, recursive content-addressed object closure, secret and size checks, atomic mode-`0600`
  import, idempotent retry, claim-bounded expiry, and separate writer-transfer acceptance. Production CI remains blocked
  pending live proof.
- feat(vnext): added recipient-bound exact provider-authority transfer commands that export only the selected preview
  binding and its referenced encrypted Terraform plan, validate all authority and file cross-links before restrictive
  atomic import, and exclude local keys, latest pointers, unrelated runtime files, and plaintext plans. Production CI
  remains blocked pending live separate-job proof.
- feat(vnext): added truthful GitHub Environment Gate 4 approval evidence derived only from strict GitHub Actions
  context, bound to the accepted writer-transfer owner, repository, branch, commit, workflow, run, job, and canonical
  recipient. The protected environment is bound through the encrypted state handoff and accepted ownership. Approval
  expiry is bounded by the exact preview. Evidence identifies the workflow actor rather than an environment reviewer,
  and production CI remains blocked pending live protected-environment proof.
- feat(vnext): support one exact post-preview writer transfer by separating semantic dependency revision from writer
  authority, authenticating claim creation against the current lease, persisting one-hop ownership lineage, and binding
  Gate 4 and provider authorization to the exact transfer claim. Terraform preview can encrypt a saved plan for an
  explicit execution recipient. Active leases, lease-bounded approval expiry, and journal compare-and-swap prevent
  pending or racing transfers from retaining authority. Production workflows remain blocked pending live proof.
- fix(vnext): make first Bicep deployment-stack preview non-mutating by listing stacks in the target resource group and
  selecting the exact configured name in process. A missing stack binds an empty managed set; malformed, duplicate, or
  wrong-scope list entries fail closed before Gate 4.
- feat(vnext): allow a newly validated deployment preview to reopen Gate 4 on the same run, preserving prior evidence
  while requiring a fresh exact approval. This supports expired-preview refresh and sequential apply/destroy without
  promotion.
- feat(vnext): add a bounded live-qualification preparation command that derives strict artifacts from the exact
  repository candidate, records native availability and validation evidence, and stops before preview with Gate 4 closed.
- feat(vnext): prepare the manual exact-head Bicep/Terraform live qualification workflow, default-deny encrypted handoff
  storage, local dispatch/retrieval launcher, and structural mutation validator. The workflow separates preview and
  Environment-approved apply authority, uses refreshed OIDC tokens, binds exact governance inputs, returns authority to
  the initiating handoff, and requires a reviewed default-branch workflow bootstrap. Backend public network access is
  Disabled at rest; each bounded session applies the policy exclusion only for that session, adds one runner `/32`, and
  verifies unconditional restoration to Disabled with the exclusion removed. It does not claim live proof until the
  user-owned GitHub and Azure ceremonies run.

### Fixed (APEX vNext security)

- fix(vnext): replace the unenforceable single-runner IP handoff exception with a reviewed, time-boxed Entra-only public
  endpoint session that retains RBAC and encryption and verifies restoration to firewall `Deny` plus network `Disabled`.
- fix(vnext): parse both canonical two-column Git porcelain and the command wrapper's first-line trimmed form when
  enforcing dispatch-only `.apex/**` drift, without permitting source changes or renames.
- fix(vnext): request Azure what-if with `--no-pretty-print` so the native Bicep provider receives strict JSON instead
  of the human diff formatter; stderr warnings remain separate and exact-preview normalization stays fail-closed.
- fix(vnext): allow dispatch to carry only repository-backed `.apex/**` preview and approval drift while retaining exact
  `main` binding and rejecting every source, workflow, rename, or non-APEX workspace change.
- fix(vnext): exclude reproducible capability source packs from repository-backed `.apex` state, matching the existing
  encrypted state-transfer allowlist while retaining locked runtime manifests and authoritative journal state.
- fix(vnext): make local APEX Gate 4 the sole deployment approval and bind it to the intended CI recipient before one
  encrypted writer/provider handoff. The unprotected GitHub Environment scopes OIDC and configuration only; CI can no
  longer create previews or approvals.
- fix(vnext): bind live qualification launch, dispatch, and release evidence to `jonathan-vella/apex-vnext`. Copied
  workflows and manifests from another repository now fail closed before cloud mutation.
- fix(vnext): replaced polynomial storage-security regular expressions over generated Bicep and Terraform source with
  a bounded line-oriented assignment scan. Adversarial dual-track coverage protects the fix in
  [#537](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/537).
- fix(vnext): launch the managed MCP server through the installed workspace-local CLI instead of assuming the VS Code
  extension host exposes a bare `apex` command on `PATH`; packed clean-consumer tests now connect over stdio and call
  kernel status through the generated configuration.
- fix(vnext): allow live qualification scenarios to start and complete after their unavailable-by-default evidence
  template is created, while rejecting pre-template and inverted timestamps.
- fix(vnext): install a nested `.apex/.gitignore` that excludes local leases, work staging, saved plans, and
  recomputable caches while preserving repository-backed project journals and evidence for cross-device resume.
- fix(vnext): return a valid structured MCP acknowledgement after recording requirements input instead of emitting
  an invalid tool result after the journal mutation succeeds.
- fix(vnext): allow `live:vnext validate` to bind supplied evidence payload files to manifest hashes and byte counts,
  rejecting missing, duplicate, tampered, or incorrectly sized evidence before release qualification is accepted.
- fix(vnext): persist native preview bindings and encrypted Terraform plans across CLI processes under restrictive local
  state, bind Terraform source/variable/lock bytes, and require explicit ownership authorization for destructive Bicep
  deployment-stack cleanup.

### Changed (Model migration — Claude Sonnet 4.6 → Claude Sonnet 5)

- chore(agents): migrated all 11 agents/subagents in the Sonnet cohort
  from `Claude Sonnet 4.6` to `Claude Sonnet 5` (API model id
  `claude-sonnet-5`) — `02-Requirements`, `04-Design`,
  `06b-Bicep CodeGen`, `06t-Terraform CodeGen`, `08-As-Built`,
  `11-Context Optimizer`, and the five IaC validate/whatif/plan/precheck
  subagents (`bicep-validate-subagent`, `bicep-whatif-subagent`,
  `terraform-validate-subagent`, `terraform-plan-subagent`,
  `policy-precheck-subagent`). `Claude Sonnet 4.6` is now
  `deprecated: true` in `model-catalog.json`, retained for audit
  history only. CodeGen agents stay pinned to `effort: high` (no
  `xhigh` escalation — AVM generation is structured execution, not
  deep reasoning).
- docs(vendor-prompting): `claude-best-practices.md` gains rule
  R-CL-10 covering Sonnet 5 migration deltas (adaptive thinking on by
  default, manual extended thinking removed, new tokenizer ~30% more
  tokens, more literal instruction following, review-harness coverage
  guidance), citing the new
  [prompting-claude-sonnet-5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-sonnet-5)
  source. `rules.json`, `family-support.md`, and `SKILL.md` source
  citations updated; `fetch-vendor-prompting-guides.mjs` now tracks the
  new source for drift detection.
- docs: updated all cross-references in
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md`, `agent-operating-frame.instructions.md`,
  `context-optimization.instructions.md`, `context-management` skill
  token budgets, `workflow-engine` handoff guide, `docs-writer`
  repo-architecture reference, the docs site (`agents.md`,
  `architecture-explorer-graph.json`), and `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`.

### Removed (tools/scripts dead-code cleanup)

- chore(scripts): delete orphaned/one-time scripts with no npm, hook, or
  CI wiring — `report-agent-body-sizes.mjs` (superseded by
  `assess-agents.mjs`), `migrate-legacy-findings.mjs` (one-time v1.0
  findings migration), `bench-hooks.sh`, `crawl-dev-site.mjs`,
  `strip-handoff-kind.py`, and the eight `markdown-prettifiers/*.py`
  one-time doc-styling tools. Companion cleanup drops the
  `markdown-prettifiers/**` ignore glob from `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`
  and the stale migration reference in `validate-challenger-findings.mjs`.

### Added (Workflow hardening — issue #425)

- feat(skills): `azure-artifacts` SKILL.md gains a `## Post-write
  validation` table (JSON → `python -m json.tool`, Bicep →
  `bicep build --stdout`, Terraform → `terraform fmt -check` +
  `terraform validate`; Markdown delegated to the lefthook
  `artifact-validation` hook). The shared agent operating-frame
  instructions reference it so every Step 1–7 agent inherits the rule.
  Guarded by `tests/scripts/test_post_write_validation.mjs`.
- feat(scripts): `safe-shell.mjs` linter gains two new rules.
  `command-portability` flags bare `rg` / `fd` / `bat` invocations in
  committed shell snippets unless a `command -v <tool>` guard appears
  in the same fence. `agent-output-no-heredoc` flags heredoc, `tee`,
  `>`, and `>>` writes targeting `agent-output/**`. Fixture-driven
  tests in `tests/scripts/test_safe_shell.mjs` cover guarded,
  unguarded, append-redirect, tee, and indented-heredoc cases.
- feat(instructions): `no-interactive-shell.instructions.md` gains
  Rule 4 (Command portability). `no-heredoc.instructions.md` gains
  the no-shell-writes-to-`agent-output/**` sub-rule.
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md` gains rules for the new
  no-shell-writes-to-agent-output and execution-subagent invocation
  prompt contracts.
- feat(agents): canonical execution-subagent invocation prompt
  template at
  `tools/apex-prompts/utility-prompts/execution-subagent.prompt.md`
  with three required H2s (`## Objective`, `## Commands`,
  `## Expected return`). Parent agents must follow this shape when
  calling `runSubagent` for validate / what-if / plan /
  policy-precheck / cost-estimate / challenger-review subagents.
- feat(schemas): `deployment-preview-v1` JSON schema at
  `tools/schemas/deployment-preview.schema.json` defines the
  five-line deploy approval block composed by 07b/07t from
  what-if / plan / policy-precheck / cost-estimate JSON.
- feat(apex-recall): new `transition` subcommand bundles
  `complete-step` (with challenger-findings gate) + N×`decide` +
  next-step `start-step` into a single atomic
  `00-session-state.json` write. Preferred path for step changes;
  legacy commands remain. Exit 2 when the challenger sidecar is
  missing (same semantics as `complete-step`). Six tests in
  `tools/apex-recall/tests/test_transition.py`.
- feat(agents): `07b-bicep-deploy` and `07t-terraform-deploy` add a
  `## Deploy Approval Block` step that renders a five-line gate
  (creates/modifies/deletes, destructive, deploy_gate, cost_delta vs
  envelope, decision) before `azd up` / `terraform apply`. Composed
  preview is persisted to
  `agent-output/{project}/06-deploy-approval.json` conforming to
  `deployment-preview-v1`.
- feat(skills): `iac-common` gains `## Bounded retry` (3-attempt cap;
  escalates with `proceed-with-substitute` / `change-region` /
  `abort`). Referenced from 07b, 07t, 04g-governance. New
  challenger-checklist entries flag missing approval blocks and
  unbounded retry loops.

### Changed (Workflow hardening — issue #425)

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` advertises
  `apex-recall transition` as the preferred call for step changes.

### Changed (tools/scripts validator wiring)

- chore(scripts): wire `validate-context-budget.mjs` into `validate:_node`
  and `validate:_node-ci` (new `validate:context-budget` alias) so the
  documented Per-Step File Re-Read Budget (HARD LIMIT) is enforced in CI
  instead of sitting unwired. The validator itself runs as part of
  `validate:_node` / `validate:_node-ci`. A standalone smoke test
  (`tools/tests/validate-context-budget.test.mjs`, runnable via
  `test:context-budget`) guards the alias wiring and validator health in
  local development.

### Rollback (Workflow hardening — issue #425)

The change is additive. Rollback paths:

- `apex-recall transition` — legacy `checkpoint` / `decide` /
  `complete-step` commands remain functional; orchestrators can
  revert to them.
- Deploy approval block — the H2 in 07b/07t can be reverted by a
  one-line agent edit; existing what-if + policy-precheck flow is
  preserved.
- safe-shell rules — additive; no behavior change for compliant
  snippets. Disable individual rules by removing them from `RULES`
  in `tools/scripts/safe-shell.mjs`.

### Changed (tools/scripts DRY — _lib/json)

- refactor(scripts): extract `readJson` / `readJsonSafe` / `writeJson` /
  `sha256File` into `tools/scripts/_lib/json.mjs` and adopt it across 11
  validators/generators (IaC contract + handoff + consistency, policy
  property map, environment manifest, SKU manifest + IaC coverage, SKU
  allowlist derivation, Draw.io baseline capture, Azure-icon freshness,
  explorer-graph generation). Removes the inline `JSON.parse(readFileSync)`
  duplication and the now-orphaned `fs` / `crypto` imports; behavior is
  byte-for-byte identical. Guarded by `tools/tests/lib/json.test.mjs`
  (`test:lib-json`).

### Changed (tools/scripts DRY — _lib/ajv-validator)

- refactor(scripts): extract the `new Ajv2020({ allErrors: true, strict:
  false })` + `addFormats` construction and the read-schema-then-compile
  `loadValidator` into `tools/scripts/_lib/ajv-validator.mjs`
  (`createAjv`, `loadValidator`). Adopt it across 8 validators (IaC
  contract + handoff, policy property map, environment manifest, SKU
  manifest, challenge-findings decisions, JSON-schema validator, artifact
  governance-schema check), removing the duplicated Ajv boilerplate and
  now-orphaned `ajv` / `ajv-formats` imports; behavior is identical.
  `validate-decision-keys.mjs` is intentionally left untouched (it omits
  `addFormats` by design). Guarded by
  `tools/tests/lib/ajv-validator.test.mjs` (`test:lib-ajv`).

### Changed (tools/scripts DRY — _lib/e2e-helpers)

- refactor(scripts): extract the duplicated `detectIacTool` and
  `fileExists` helpers (byte-identical across `benchmark-e2e.mjs` and
  `validate-e2e-step.mjs`) into `tools/scripts/_lib/e2e-helpers.mjs`, and
  point the e2e family's inline JSON readers at the existing
  `_lib/json.mjs` helpers (`readJsonSafe` for the null-on-error variant in
  `benchmark-e2e` + `combine-e2e-runs`; strict `readJson` in
  `measure-workflow-baseline`). `validate-e2e-step`'s JSON output contract
  is unchanged. Guarded by `tools/tests/lib/e2e-helpers.test.mjs`
  (`test:lib-e2e`).

### Changed (tools/scripts consolidation — validate-models)

- refactor(scripts): merge the three read-only model validators
  (`validate-model-catalog`, `validate-model-consistency`,
  `validate-deprecated-models`) into a single
  `tools/scripts/validate-models.mjs` with `--only=catalog|consistency|deprecated`
  (no flag runs all three). The `validate:model-catalog`,
  `validate:model-consistency`, and `validate:deprecated-models` npm
  aliases are preserved as thin pass-throughs, so hooks/CI are unchanged;
  a new `validate:models` runs the full set. Per-mode output is
  byte-for-byte identical to the former scripts (verified by diff against
  a `main` worktree). The mutating generator (`generate-model-catalog.mjs`)
  stays separate, and its `buildAssignments` helper moves into
  `_lib/model-helpers.mjs` — removing the former validator→generator
  import. All live in-repo references to the three former script paths
  (code comments, the agent-registry schema description, model-catalog.json
  metadata, vendor-prompting instructions + skill references, and the
  regenerated architecture-explorer-graph.json) are repointed to
  `validate-models.mjs`; historical CHANGELOG / QUALITY_SCORE entries are
  left intact. Guarded by `tools/tests/validate-models.test.mjs`
  (`test:models`).

### Added (docs)

- docs(concepts): add `concepts/workflow-deep-dive` — long-form
  integration view of a single APEX run covering the five context
  surfaces (skills, instructions, `.github/data/` registries,
  `apex-recall`, hooks), a per-stage sub-template walkthrough for
  Steps 1 → 7 + Post-Lessons, and the lessons-feedback loop. Ships with
  a regenerable Python-diagrams source at
  `site/src/assets/diagrams/workflow-deep-dive/gen.py` plus the
  end-to-end orchestration and lessons-loop PNGs. Sidebar entry added
  under _Concepts_ as a sibling to _How It Works_.

### Added (Plan 01 — token-reduction workstream)

- `tools/scripts/profile_debug_log.py` + `npm run profile:debug-log` —
  OTel debug-log profiler extracting token totals, per-model splits,
  askQuestions count + duration, subagent wall-time, duplicate
  file-read map, tool-payload sizes, error counts, and compliance
  warnings. Reference: `.github/skills/context-management/references/log-profiling.md`.
- `agent-output/_baselines/multi-log-baseline.json` — multi-log
  baseline (5 OTel sessions, p50/p90/max) used by Plan 01 Phase 5
  targets. `.gitignore` updated to allow this single deliverable
  through while keeping ephemeral snapshots ignored.
- `tools/scripts/validate_orchestrator_handoff.py` +
  `npm run validate:orchestrator-handoff` — Gate-boundary `/clear`
  handoff contract lint (Plan 01 Phase 2a). Hard fail when the
  verbatim resume line, the `apex-recall checkpoint` precondition, or
  the resume-path first tool call is removed or paraphrased.
- `tools/scripts/validate_review_ceiling.py` +
  `npm run validate:review-ceiling` — dual-mode validator: contract
  lint (default-depth ceiling = 2, deep-depth ceiling = 4 challenger
  passes per step) and budget mode (`--budget LOGFILE`) that counts
  per-step invocations in an OTel log.
- `tools/scripts/validate_question_batching.py` +
  `npm run validate:question-batching` — Plan 01 Phase 4 P0 directive
  plus 6-question example lint for `02-requirements.agent.md`.
- `tests/integration/smoke-run.md` — Plan 01 acceptance harness
  (manual Steps 1 → 2 with `/clear` boundaries, captures askQuestions
  count, challenger invocations, inter-`/clear` chat-span max,
  post-`/clear` first input tokens).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/copilot-chat-feedback.md` — upstream issue
  template for Copilot Chat behaviour outside any agent's reach
  (e.g. the parallel-retry race documented in
  `docs/devcontainer-hygiene.md`).

### Changed (Plan 01 — token-reduction workstream)

- **Gate-boundary `/clear` handoff** is now mandatory at every
  accepted Gate (1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5) in `01-orchestrator.agent.md`.
  The orchestrator must run `apex-recall checkpoint` first, present
  the gate, then end the message with a verbatim resume line. The
  full contract lives in
  `.github/skills/context-management/references/compression-templates.md`.
- **Challenger-invocation ceiling**: per-step cap of 2 passes
  (`default` depth) or 4 passes (`deep` depth) with explicit
  Accept / Override / Abort `askQuestions` recovery when exceeded.
  New keys `challenger_invocations_<step>`, `challenger_override_<step>`,
  `challenger_decision_<step>` registered in
  `tools/apex-recall/docs/decision-keys.md`.
- **Filesystem precheck**: `.github/instructions/azure-artifacts.instructions.md`
  now scopes the "edit, don't `create_file`" rule explicitly to the
  three high-frequency artifacts (`sku-manifest.json`, `00-handoff.md`,
  `README.md`). General rule unchanged.
- **`.digest.md` reconciliation**: deleted the stale
  `orchestrator-handoff-guide.digest.md` reference in
  `01-orchestrator.agent.md` (digest tier was retired in
  commit `24a35809`). Decision captured in
  `/memories/repo/codegen-model-mix-2026.md`.
- **Orchestrator init**: `Starting a New Project` step 4 now
  explicitly says `create_directory` (not a `create_file`
  placeholder) for `agent-output/{project}/`.
- **02-Requirements**: P0 directive subsection at top of Phase 1
  with explicit 6-question numbered example for `askQuestions`
  batching. Target: askQuestions count ≤ 10 per Step 1.
- **Model mix swaps** (5 immediate, 1 A/B-gated):
  - 05-iac-planner: Claude Opus 4.7 → Claude Sonnet 4.6
  - 04g-governance, 07b-bicep-deploy, 07t-terraform-deploy, 10-challenger (wrapper):
    GPT-5.5 → GPT-5.3-Codex
  - 11-context-optimizer: Claude Opus 4.7 → Claude Sonnet 4.6
  - `challenger-review-subagent` (subagent): GPT-5.5 → Sonnet 4.6
    is **A/B-gated** on the `test/challenger-sonnet` branch — not
    merged. Rollback path + quality rubric in
    `/memories/repo/codegen-model-mix-2026.md`.
- **PR template**: added a "Token / latency impact" section so
  PR authors confirm whether the change moves the input-token or
  per-turn-latency budget.

### Changed (other)

- refactor(agents)!: migrate `06b-Bicep CodeGen` and `06t-Terraform CodeGen`
  from `GPT-5.5` to `Claude Sonnet 4.6`. Frontmatter `model:` flipped,
  `tools/registry/agent-registry.json` mirrored, `.github/model-catalog.json`
  regenerated (Sonnet 4.6 `use_for` adds `iac-codegen`; GPT-5.5 drops it).
  Bodies kept structurally GPT-5.5 outcome-first — only minimal change is the
  existing `## Output Contract` heading converted to an `<output_contract>`
  XML block to satisfy the Anthropic `claude-output-contract-001` rule.
  All verbatim invariants (security baseline, AVM-first contract, Phase 1.5
  HARD GATE language, `apex-recall` calls, subagent JSON consumption shape,
  Do/Don't entries) preserved byte-exact. Rationale: family alignment with the
  Sonnet validate/whatif/plan subagents these agents already dispatch, plus
  stronger verbatim invariant retention under XML-tagged contracts. Does not
  re-trigger QUALITY_SCORE 2026-05-12 (no `<context_awareness>` block added).
- feat(agents): migrate `09-Diagnose` to `GPT-5.5` and convert
  `diagnose-resource.prompt.md` to the outcome-first GPT-5.5 skeleton while
  preserving approval-first Azure diagnostics and report output.
- refactor(agents)!: simplify challenger reviews — default flow is now
  **single-pass `comprehensive`** at every mandatory step (1, 2, 4); Step 3.5
  runs `governance-reconciliation`; multi-pass rotating-lens review is
  **opt-in only** (`decisions.review_depth = "deep"` or explicit
  `10-Challenger` invocation). Tier-driven auto-fire is removed.
  **Breaking schema changes** (no alias, no deprecation window — single
  monorepo, no external consumers):
  - Rename per-step `complexity_matrix` → `opt_in_matrix` in
    `workflow-graph.json` (4 occurrences: step-2, step-4, step-5b, step-5t),
    `tools/schemas/workflow-graph.schema.json` (dropped the `required:
["simple","standard","complex"]` array under the matrix to reflect opt-in
    semantics — partial tier subsets are now allowed),
    `tools/scripts/validate-workflow-graph.mjs` (`validateChallenger()`),
    `.github/skills/workflow-engine/references/orchestrator-handoff-guide.md`,
    `orchestrator-handoff-guide.digest.md`,
    `tools/tests/subagent-file-contract.test.mjs`,
    `tools/tests/fixtures/subagent-file-contract/challenger-review.findings.json`,
    `tools/tests/bats/subagent-validation.bats`.
  - Step 4 default lens: `security-governance` → `comprehensive`.
  - New `governance-reconciliation` lens (added to `VALID_LENSES` and
    `challenger-review-subagent` `review_focus` enum).
  - New return_edges in `workflow-graph.json`: `step-4 → step-2` on
    `on_architecture_must_fix` and `step-3_5 → step-2` on
    `on_must_fix_governance_conflict` (closes gate-3 livelock when a
    finding carries `requires_step == "step-2"`; reconciliation never
    self-edits the approved architecture).
  - New challenger findings JSON shape (`schema_version: "1.0"`): adds
    `traces_to: string[]`, `suggested_fix: { artifact_path, line_range?,
proposed_edit }`, `requires_step: string`, and a `cache_inputs` block
    holding individual `artifact_sha`, `checklists_sha`, `protocol_sha`,
    `subagent_sha`, `model` plus the combined `artifact_hash`. Validated by
    new `tools/scripts/validate-challenger-findings.mjs`
    (`npm run validate:challenger-findings`).
  - Legacy `agent-output/nordic-foods/challenge-findings-*.json` (9 files)
    migrated once via `tools/scripts/migrate-legacy-findings.mjs`
    (`issues→findings`, `title→claim`, `description→evidence`,
    `failure_scenario→impact`, `suggested_mitigation→suggested_fix.proposed_edit`).
    The dangling `$schema` pointer is removed by the migration.
  - `.github/skills/azure-defaults/references/challenger-selection-rules.md`
    deleted (folded into `adversarial-review-protocol.md → ## Opt-in: Deep
adversarial review`). Inbound refs repointed in 06b/06t CodeGen agents,
    `iac-common/references/codegen-shared-workflow.md`, and the site doc.
  - New `decisions.review_depth ∈ {"default", "deep"}`, captured **once**
    per project by `01-Orchestrator` only (02-Requirements reads but never
    writes). Validated by `tools/scripts/validate-session-state.mjs`.
  - New artifact-hash findings cache: parent agents reuse prior findings
    when ALL of `artifact_sha`, `checklists_sha`, `protocol_sha`,
    `subagent_sha`, and `model` match the cached `cache_inputs`.
  - New scripts: `tools/scripts/lessons-to-checklists.mjs`
    (`npm run report:challenger-gaps`),
    `tools/scripts/challenger-telemetry.mjs`
    (`npm run challenger-telemetry`),
    `tools/scripts/validate-lens-references.mjs`
    (`npm run validate:lens-references`, wired into `validate:all`).
  - `10-Challenger` wrapper now defaults to `comprehensive`; multi-pass
    and batch mode is the explicit opt-in entry point. Retirement-review
    trigger documented (≥ 20 invocations OR 30 days post-merge).
- chore(catalog): drop the `(High reasoning)` suffix from the Opus 4.7 label.
  `Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning)` and `Claude Opus 4.7` were two distinct
  catalog entries pointing at the same SKU. Reasoning-effort policy is now a
  per-agent decision documented in
  `.github/instructions/agent-authoring.instructions.md` (see the
  "Reasoning-effort policy" subsection), not encoded in the model label.
  Updates: 4 agent frontmatters (Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner,
  Context Optimizer), 4 prompt frontmatters, 5 registry rows, model catalog
  (entries merged + assignments regenerated), vendor-prompting rules and
  fixtures, classify-model test, and supporting docs. Historical changelog
  entries left intact (audit-trail integrity).

### Added

- feat(agents): migrate the three remaining GPT-5.4 main agents
  (`07b-bicep-deploy`, `07t-terraform-deploy`, `08-as-built`) to `GPT-5.5`
  with outcome-first body rewrites (`Role` / `# Goal` / `# Success criteria`
  / `# Constraints` / `# Output` / `# Stop rules`). `08-as-built` gains a
  `## Subagent Budget` H2 for symmetry with the deploy agents. `GPT-5.4`
  flipped to `deprecated: true` in `.github/model-catalog.json` with zero
  remaining active assignments — the GPT-5.4 cohort is fully retired.
  `GPT-5.5` `use_for` adds `deployment-execution` and
  `as-built-documentation`. The cross-family gap between
  `as-built-from-azure.prompt.md` (GPT-5.5) and its target `08-As-Built`
  agent is closed (both same-family). The orphan
  `review-imported-iac.prompt.md` (previously GPT-5.4) is also migrated to
  `GPT-5.5`. `lint-model-alignment.mjs` gains a `gpt-5.5` classifier branch
  (pre-existing blind spot — every existing GPT-5.5 agent previously
  classified as `unknown`). `.github/skills/vendor-prompting/rules.json`
  cleaned of retired GPT-5.4 family registry entry,
  `gpt55-skeleton-001.family_overrides`, and
  `gpt-no-claude-xml-001`/`personality-scoping-001` `model_families` arrays.
  `e2e-orchestrator` (was Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning), now `GPT-5.5`)
  also rewritten in the GPT-5.5 outcome-first style. Catalog gains a new
  `Claude Opus 4.7` (no reasoning suffix) entry used by `09-Diagnose`.
- feat(agents): migrate the Orchestrator (was Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning))
  and the Sonnet 4.6 cohort (Orchestrator Fast Path, Design, Governance,
  Bicep CodeGen, Terraform CodeGen, Challenger, challenger-review-subagent)
  to `GPT-5.5`. Eight agents + one subagent receive full GPT-5.5 prompt
  rewrites following the OpenAI prompting guide skeleton (Role / Personality
  / Goal / Success / Constraints / Output / Stop), layered around the
  existing required sections (output_contract, security baseline, workflow
  contracts) which stay verbatim. Four prompt files swap accordingly
  (`01-orchestrator.prompt.md`, `resume-workflow.prompt.md`,
  `04-design.prompt.md`, `as-built-from-azure.prompt.md` — the last
  intentionally GPT-5.5 even though it invokes the GPT-5.4 08-As-Built
  agent, to keep the prompt-author UX consistent across the migrated
  cohort). Eight registry rows updated. Orchestrator self-reference body
  table corrected (high-row 'Code Gen' attribution fixed; low-row tier
  retired in favor of a footnote pointing at the registry). The six
  Opus 4.7 agents (Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner, Diagnose, Context
  Optimizer, E2E Orchestrator) and the GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.3-Codex agents and
  subagents are unchanged.
- chore(catalog): redesign `.github/model-catalog.json` as model metadata
  (`models`, hand-maintained label allow-list) plus auto-generated
  `assignments` (mirrored from frontmatter). Adds `governance` block
  documenting the source-of-truth chain. Replaces the retired `floors`
  block. Adds `GPT-5.5` (tier `balanced`) and marks `Claude Sonnet 4.6`
  `deprecated: true`.
- feat(tools): add `generate-model-catalog.mjs` (rebuilds `assignments`
  from frontmatter; `--check` mode for CI drift detection) and
  `validate-model-catalog.mjs` (enforces label allow-list, assignments
  match generator output, deprecated models absent from active
  assignments). Wired into `validate:_node` / `validate:_node-ci`. Adds a
  lefthook pre-commit hook that auto-regenerates `assignments` whenever an
  agent frontmatter file is staged.
- feat(agents): migrate Opus-tier agents from `Claude Opus 4.6` to
  `Claude Opus 4.7 (High reasoning)`. Updates 7 agent frontmatters
  (Orchestrator, Requirements, Architect, IaC Planner, Diagnose,
  Context Optimizer, E2E Orchestrator), 4 prompt frontmatters
  (`01-orchestrator.prompt.md`, `resume-workflow.prompt.md`,
  `doc-gardening.prompt.md`, `tools/tests/prompts/e2e-analyze-lessons.prompt.md`),
  the 7 corresponding rows in `tools/registry/agent-registry.json`, and the
  Orchestrator self-reference body table. The `Claude Opus 4.6` catalog entry
  is retained with `deprecated: true` for audit history. Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5
  are unchanged.
- feat(tools): replace `validate-model-floors.mjs` + the `KNOWN_MODELS`
  allow-list in `validate-agent-registry.mjs` with a single
  `validate-model-consistency.mjs` check. The agent's YAML frontmatter
  `model` field is now the single source of truth; the registry mirrors it
  and the catalog is documentation only (not enforced). Adds
  `validate:model-consistency` to `validate:_node` and `validate:_node-ci`;
  removes `lint:model-floors`.
- feat(agents): retire workspace-wide `<!-- Recommended reasoning_effort: ... -->`
  HTML annotation. Removed from 15 agent files (Orchestrator, Requirements,
  Architect, Design, Governance, IaC Planner, Bicep CodeGen, Terraform CodeGen,
  As-Built, Diagnose, Challenger, Context Optimizer, E2E Orchestrator,
  Orchestrator Fast Path, challenger-review-subagent) and from
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md`. `validate-agents.mjs` and
  `lint-model-alignment.mjs` Check 3 (reasoning_effort presence) deleted;
  remaining checks renumbered 4 → 3 (large-agent context_awareness) and
  5 → 4 (investigate_before_answering).

### Changed

- chore(audit): Phase 5 of the Opus 4.7 migration audited the 7 Opus agents
  end-to-end against Anthropic's published 4.7 behavioral changes. Strengthened
  the Orchestrator's gate-1 challenger pass language (now declared "**Mandatory:**…
  not optional and must not be skipped") and rewrote `## Resuming a Project`
  to require a 3-signal absence (no apex-recall state, no `00-handoff.md`,
  no numbered artifacts) before treating a project as new — mitigating 4.7's
  stricter literalism on empty `apex-recall show` responses. Audit table
  archived under `tmp/phase5-opus-audit-table.md`.
- docs: update `agent-authoring.instructions.md` § `model` to document the
  new source-of-truth (frontmatter canonical, registry mirrors, catalog is
  documentation), the array/string/JSON-string frontmatter form mandate, and
  the YAML-bareword forbidden form. Update `[claude-guide]:` reference link
  to the current `platform.claude.com` URL.

- refactor(hooks): consolidate agent hooks — merge `governance-audit/` and
  `session-logger/` into single `session-telemetry/` directory. Adds `tool-audit/`
  (PostToolUse metadata logging), gitleaks pre-commit guard, bats-based hook
  test suite, and CI enforcement. Lefthook pre-commit consolidated (5→2 validator
  commands, parallel enabled) and post-commit removed (checks migrated to pre-push).

- refactor(tools): consolidate tests under `tools/tests/`.
  Moves `tests/` → `tools/tests/`. Updates npm test commands,
  markdownlint excludes, and documentation references.

- refactor(tools): consolidate validation scripts under `tools/scripts/`.
  Moves `scripts/` → `tools/scripts/`. Updates 45+ npm scripts, lefthook
  hooks, CI workflows, instruction applyTo globs, and documentation.

- refactor(tools): consolidate registry files under `tools/registry/`.
  Moves `.github/agent-registry.json` and `.github/count-manifest.json`
  to `tools/registry/`. Updates path references across scripts, agents,
  skills, instructions, prompts, workflows, and documentation.

- refactor(tools): consolidate MCP servers under `tools/mcp-servers/`.
  Moves `mcp/azure-pricing-mcp/` → `tools/mcp-servers/azure-pricing/` and
  `mcp/drawio-mcp-server/` → `tools/mcp-servers/drawio/`. Updates all path
  references across config, devcontainer, agents, docs, and validation.

- feat(cli): `apex-recall` CLI v0.2.0 for progressive cross-project session recall.
  Indexes `agent-output/` into SQLite + FTS5 for low-token context recovery.
  Owns the full session lifecycle (read + write) via CLI commands; replaces the
  deleted `session-resume` skill.

- refactor(tools): consolidate JSON schemas under `tools/schemas/`.
  Moves `schemas/*.schema.json` → `tools/schemas/`. Updates all `$schema`,
  `$id`, path constants, and documentation references.

### Changed

- feat(governance): `schemas/governance-constraints.schema.json` is now
  enforced at validation time. `scripts/validate-artifacts.mjs` compiles the
  schema with AJV (draft 2020-12) and validates every
  `agent-output/*/04-governance-constraints.json` artifact in Step 5b. Drops
  the schema from advisory-only to hard-gate for the JSON companion.
- feat(governance): structured policy-override pattern — `04g-Governance` now
  emits Deny findings with an optional `override` block (`reason`, `issue_link`,
  `expiry`) instead of silently dropping overridden policies. Codegen agents
  (`06b`/`06t`) treat overrides as informational warnings and inject
  `// OVERRIDE <id> until <date> — see <issue>` banner comments above affected
  resources; missing fields or past expiry fail closed. JSON shape captured in
  new `schemas/governance-constraints.schema.json` (`schema_version:
governance-constraints-v1`) for future AJV enforcement.
- fix(agents): normalise `e2e-orchestrator.agent.md` model frontmatter to the
  standard array form `["Claude Opus 4.6"]` (was the only agent using the
  `"Claude Opus 4.6 (copilot)"` string form).
- feat(orchestrator): document the complexity auto-calc procedure in
  `01-orchestrator.agent.md` — formula read from `workflow-graph.json`
  `metadata.complexity_routing`, inputs sourced from architecture + governance
  artefacts, result persisted at `decisions.complexity` so every downstream
  agent reads the same value.
- docs: admonition taxonomy (`note`/`tip`/`caution`/`danger`) and mandatory
  `## Related` footer pattern documented in `docs.instructions.md`; footers
  added to the 6 guide pages that lacked them.
- feat(drawio): 10-point visual-quality rubric (title, footer, legend, grouping,
  spacing, palette, edge labels, canonical icons, anchor stability, cross-cutting
  container) added to `.github/skills/drawio/references/validation-checklist.md`
  with `automated?`/rationale columns. Formalise APEX palette (compute `#E7F5FF`,
  data `#FFF2CC`, security `#FFE6E6`, networking `#E6F5E6`, governance `#F5F5F5`),
  typography (title 14–16pt, service 11pt, footer 9pt), and spacing (40/80/120 px)
  in `style-reference.md`. `scripts/validate-drawio-files.mjs` adds an advisory
  palette-drift check on `03-des-*`, `04-*-diagram`, `07-ab-*`, and `showcase-*`
  files; promote to blocking with `APEX_DRAWIO_RUBRIC=strict` (default advisory
  until 0.12.0).
- perf(mcp): Azure Pricing MCP — raise HTTP pool ceiling 10→20 (per-host 5→10)
  and dedup cache TTL 30s→300s / capacity 100→512 entries, configurable via
  `AZURE_PRICING_HTTP_POOL_SIZE`, `AZURE_PRICING_HTTP_POOL_PER_HOST`,
  `AZURE_PRICING_DEDUP_TTL`, `AZURE_PRICING_DEDUP_MAX_ENTRIES`. Defaults also
  surfaced in `.vscode/mcp.json`. Cuts repeated-query latency on multi-region
  bulk estimates; retail prices refresh at most hourly so 5-min reuse is safe.
- feat(agents): add `.github/model-catalog.json` (single source of allowed Copilot
  models with vendor, tier, release date, and deprecation flag) plus
  `scripts/validate-model-floors.mjs` wired into `validate:_node` and CI. Extend
  `.github/skills/workflow-engine/templates/workflow-graph.json` with a
  deterministic `complexity_routing` formula (resource count, policy violations,
  IaC-tool weight → passes) so orchestrators auto-route challenger passes from
  session state instead of guessing.
- docs: single-source glossary — `docs/GLOSSARY.md` is now a 9-line stub pointing
  to `site/src/content/docs/reference/glossary.md` (removes 570-line duplicate,
  fixes circular `#orchestrator` self-link, moves Orchestrator to its own `## O`
  section). Clarify `VERSION.md` 0.10.0 status as pre-release/Unreleased.
- chore(instructions): narrow overly-broad `applyTo` globs on `no-heredoc`,
  `no-hardcoded-counts`, `markdown`, and `code-quality` to reclaim context budget
  on every agent load. Merge `agent-research-first.instructions.md` into
  `agent-authoring.instructions.md` (single source). Upgrade
  `scripts/validate-glob-audit.mjs` to flag any `applyTo: "**"` plus oversized
  `**/*.md` globs.
- feat(azd): per-project azd multi-project support — `azure.yaml` and `.azure/` now live
  inside `infra/{iac}/{project}/` (co-located with `infra.path: .`), replacing the
  repo-root convention that broke multi-project isolation. Environment naming uses
  `{project}-{env}` (e.g., `hub-spoke-dev`). All `.azure/plan.md` references across
  50+ files updated to project-scoped paths.
- feat(azd): add azd support to the Terraform path — 06t-terraform-codegen now generates
  `azure.yaml` (with `infra.provider: terraform`) and `main.tfvars.json` parameter mapping;
  07t-terraform-deploy gains azd detection with fallback to pure `terraform apply`.
- feat(skills): new `iac-common/references/azd-vs-deploy-guide.md` — consolidated reference
  comparing azd vs deploy.ps1 (comparison table, per-project conventions, workflow, hooks,
  azure.yaml schema, detection logic, troubleshooting). Cross-linked from azure-deploy,
  recipe-selection, and azd-deployment SDK reference.
- feat(docs): new `site/src/content/docs/guides/azd-deployment.mdx` — Astro Starlight docs
  site guide covering azd vs deploy.ps1, per-project layout, workflow, hooks, schema, and
  troubleshooting.
- feat(security): expand IaC security baseline with 6 new rules — `allowSharedKeyAccess`,
  App Service HTTP/2, MySQL SSL, Container Registry admin user (all blocking), plus
  `defaultToOAuthAuthentication` (warning). WAF pillar tagging (SE:05/06/07) and MCSB links
  added to docs site. Updated AGENTS.md security section.
- refactor(scripts): migrate 6 validators to shared Reporter pattern — validate-governance-refs,
  validate-hooks, validate-instruction-checks, validate-drawio-files, validate-excalidraw-files,
  validate-iac-security-baseline. New `_lib/regex-helpers.mjs` (`findAllMatches`) eliminates
  fragile manual `lastIndex` resets. New `_lib/glob-helpers.mjs` (`walkFiles`) provides
  consistent file-walking with symlink detection.
- fix(scripts): remove unnecessary `/g` flag from per-line `.test()` patterns in
  `check-docs-freshness.mjs` (root cause of `lastIndex` fragility).
- refactor(agents): reduce prompt-body duplication by trimming the largest deploy, architect,
  and E2E agents; extract shared deploy, codegen, placeholder-scan, and direct-execution
  protocols into reusable skill references; and raise the advisory large-agent context target
  from 300 to 350 body lines in repo guidance and validators.
- refactor(instructions): replace the monolithic IaC guidance with split Bicep, Terraform,
  and implementation-plan instruction files plus shared policy, security, and cost-monitoring
  references.
- refactor(docs): align repository docs and site docs with `.github/agents`,
  `.github/instructions`, and `.github/skills` as the single source of truth, including
  current subagent names and instruction filenames.
- feat(skills): update the `azure-deploy` skill so a missing `.azure/plan.md` automatically
  triggers the `azure-prepare` then `azure-validate` flow before deployment proceeds.
