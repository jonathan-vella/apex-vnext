## APEX vNext Decision Index

This index is append-only. Amend a decision with a new entry rather than rewriting its historical context. Add an ADR
when a decision has lasting architectural consequences that need alternatives and trade-off analysis.

## DECISION-001: Use Hybrid Project Governance

- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Owner:** `@jonathan-vella`
- **Context:** vNext needs durable intent across devices without duplicating granular work state in repository files.
- **Options:** Repository-only tracking; GitHub-only tracking; hybrid repository and GitHub tracking.
- **Choice:** PRD, roadmap, register, decisions, and checkpoints live in the repository. Issues own executable status. The
  GitHub Project is a view over issues and pull requests.
- **Rationale:** Stable governance benefits from reviewable version history, while assignment and daily state need GitHub
  workflow semantics.
- **Consequences:** `PROJECT.md` stays concise; issue checkpoints are mandatory before pausing; mutable status cannot have
  two owners.
- **ADR:** Not required; this is a delivery-governance choice.
- **Issue/PR:** [#536](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/536),
  [PR #548](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/pull/548)

## DECISION-002: Use The Existing Integration Branch

- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Owner:** `@jonathan-vella`
- **Context:** Phase 0A deferred a long-lived vNext branch, but implementation now spans repository packages, configuration,
  customizations, tools, and documentation under draft PR #533.
- **Options:** Copy from a temporary repository at the end; work directly on one branch; use an integration branch with
  isolated issue worktrees.
- **Choice:** Keep `feat/apex-vnext-rewrite` as the durable integration branch. Execute slices on short-lived issue branches
  in isolated worktrees and target their pull requests to the integration branch.
- **Rationale:** This preserves history, continuously tests real repository integration, and avoids a second bulk migration
  that would invalidate exact-head evidence.
- **Consequences:** The Phase 0A branch-sequencing assumption is superseded, but its no-tag and no-cutover safety intent
  remains. PR #533 stays draft and `main` stays on v1.
- **ADR:** Not required; repository topology is captured by the project controls.
- **Issue/PR:** [#536](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/536),
  [PR #548](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/pull/548)

## DECISION-003: Modernize Through Dependency-Complete Vertical Slices

- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Owner:** `@jonathan-vella`
- **Context:** Guidance, validators, scripts, workflows, hooks, generated metadata, packages, and documentation have
  cross-domain dependencies.
- **Options:** Rewrite by repository area; mass rewrite; inventory first and migrate one dependency-complete slice at a
  time.
- **Choice:** Inventory the whole ownership surface, then execute independently revertible vertical slices with
  characterization, migration, compatibility, validation, measurement, and documentation.
- **Rationale:** Cross-domain behavior and diagnostics must remain equivalent while duplicate ownership is retired.
- **Consequences:** Unrelated cleanup cannot be bundled into a slice; a worsened release gate requires revert or explicit
  acceptance with owner and expiry.
- **ADR:** Create ADRs only for consequential canonical-ownership decisions.
- **Issue/PR:** [#545](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/545)

## DECISION-004: Keep Improvement Observe-And-Propose Only

- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Owner:** `@jonathan-vella`
- **Context:** Recurring deterministic failures can inform improvements, but untrusted observations must not gain runtime
  or repository authority.
- **Options:** Autonomous self-modification; automated issue and pull-request creation; bounded observation and inert
  proposals with human decisions.
- **Choice:** Extend the existing quality and evidence lifecycle with schema-first observations, recurrence, proposals,
  and human decisions. Proposals remain inert.
- **Rationale:** This captures useful recurrence without creating prompt-injection, approval, deployment, or mutation
  paths.
- **Consequences:** MCP may submit bounded observations or read proposals, but cannot decide, apply, edit, create pull
  requests, approve gates, publish, or deploy. Automated issue creation needs a later decision.
- **ADR:** Required before implementing the improvement subsystem; compare the referenced upstream design and provenance.
- **Issue/PR:** [#546](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/546)

## DECISION-005: Keep VS Code As The Only First-Release Agent Runtime

- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Owner:** `@jonathan-vella`
- **Context:** The managed customization architecture and qualification plan target supported VS Code Copilot contracts.
- **Options:** Qualify multiple agent runtimes; support VS Code only for the first release.
- **Choice:** Remain VS Code-only for vNext.
- **Rationale:** Broad runtime support would multiply handoff, tool, model-tier, security, and qualification surfaces before
  the first release is proven.
- **Consequences:** GitHub Copilot CLI and other agent runtimes are out of scope. Runtime expansion requires a new decision
  and qualification plan.
- **ADR:** Not required until runtime expansion is proposed.
- **Issue/PR:** [#543](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/543)

## DECISION-006: Extend The Existing Bug Form For Regressions

- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Owner:** Repository maintainers
- **Context:** The existing bug form captures description and reproduction but not integration head, failed check, or
  regression test provenance.
- **Options:** Add a separate regression form; extend the existing form with optional vNext provenance fields.
- **Choice:** Extend the bug form and keep one defect intake path.
- **Rationale:** A second mutable defect intake would fragment triage while adding no distinct lifecycle.
- **Consequences:** Regression issues can bind head, check, expected behavior, and proof test without burdening ordinary
  bug reports.
- **ADR:** Not required.
- **Issue/PR:** [#536](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/536),
  [PR #548](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/pull/548)

## DECISION-007: Treat The Historical Build Plan As Superseded Input

- **Date:** 2026-07-14
- **Owner:** Product governance
- **Context:** The historical build plan mixes locked requirements, phase sequencing, and status assumptions that no longer
  match the implemented repository.
- **Options:** Maintain both plans; delete the old plan; preserve it as historical input and move binding content into the
  PRD and roadmap.
- **Choice:** Preserve the old plan, mark it superseded, and use [PRD.md](PRD.md) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) as the
  active product and delivery authorities.
- **Rationale:** This retains design provenance without creating two mutable plans.
- **Consequences:** New scope changes require a decision and PRD update. Historical phase labels are traceability only.
- **ADR:** Not required.
- **Issue/PR:** [#536](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/issues/536),
  [PR #548](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/apex/pull/548)

## DECISION-008: Extract vNext To A Dedicated Repository

- **Date:** 2026-07-16
- **Owner:** `@jonathan-vella`
- **Context:** The vNext runtime, qualification infrastructure, and release controls are independently testable, while
  the original APEX repository must retain its v1 `main` line.
- **Options:** Merge vNext into the original `main`; continue indefinitely on a rolling branch; create a dedicated
  repository with full history; create a dedicated repository from a qualified clean snapshot.
- **Choice:** Create private repository `jonathan-vella/apex-vnext` from source commit
  `60d96d5a46ff534069c58275cfd32cb8d4490971` as a clean snapshot. Use its `main` branch for vNext integration. Exclude
  the Astro site and maintain repository-native Markdown under `docs/`.
- **Rationale:** This keeps the original v1 line untouched, removes unrelated site coupling, and gives vNext a default
  branch that can host its dispatch-only qualification workflow without merging candidate runtime into the old repo.
- **Consequences:** Source SHAs are recorded as provenance rather than preserved as destination history. Live and final
  qualification must bind to destination commits. Open vNext issues move to the new repository, while old draft pull
  requests close unmerged with migration receipts.
- **ADR:** Not required; this is a repository and release-governance decision.
- **Issue/PR:** See [repository migration](../MIGRATION.md).
